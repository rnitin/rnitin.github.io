            I am an R&D Software Engineer at Bastian Solutions in Dallas, TX.
            I specialize in developing advanced algorithms for perception and decision making, along with machine learning model development, for custom supply chain and logistics robots.
            Key projects I have contributed to include the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBh74Jg7J6U">ULTRA Blue Trailer Unloader Robots</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVOn-i8JZbE">SmartPick Robotic Bin Picking Solution</a>.

            In 2023, I earned an M.S. in Computer Engineering from Texas A&M University.
            During my studies, I was a member of the <a href="https://cesg.tamu.edu/people-2/faculty/srinivas-shakkottai/lens-lab/">LENS group</a> in the ECE department.
            My research focused on <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/0b99315234cc95e6ef281f9155b68832-Abstract-Conference.html">federated and distributed reinforcement learning</a>, robot learning for manipulation and navigation, and human-robot interaction.

            In the summer of 2022, I attended the <a href="https://robotics-summerschool.ethz.ch/"> Robotics Summer School</a> held at ETH Zurich.
            I integrated ROS packages to implement perception, planning, and control of a semi-autonomous robot.

            I earned my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli in 2020.
            During the summer of 2019, I worked on the control and collision avoidance of multi-agent mobile robots at <a href="http://acm.me.dal.ca/"> ACM Lab</a>, Dalhousie University, through the Mitacs Globalink Research Intership program.
            In 2018, I developed a haptic interface to improve obstacle perception during UAV tele-operation at Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
